# 💖 What Do You Like? 💖

**What Do You Like?** is an engaging and fun web app where users explore their preferences by selecting their favorite images from a range of exciting categories. Through a series of comparisons, users narrow down their choices until the app reveals their top pick with a celebratory message! 🎉

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Category Selection**: Choose from a variety of categories:
  - 🚗 **Cars**
  - 🎬 **Movies**
  - 🍜 **Cuisine**
  - 🎨 **Anime**
  - 🏢 **Brands**

- 🖼️ **Dynamic Image Comparisons**: For each category, users are presented with two images at a time. After selecting one, a new image appears for comparison. Repeat the process until you've made ten choices!

- 🏆 **Final Reveal**: Once you've made 10 selections, the app celebrates your choice by showing your favorite image and a congratulatory message. 🎊

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Ensures a clean, modern, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic content loading and user interactions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Select a category (Cars, Movies, etc.).
2. Compare two images from that category and choose the one you like more.
3. After 10 rounds of selection, the app reveals your favorite image with a congratulatory message!
